# FoodScannerApp

The trend of healthy eating is on the rise. Consumers are paying more attention to nutrition labels as they get more health conscious. However, they may not truly understand what the information portrayed on the label is about.
<br>
<br>
This project looks to provide an interpretational visual aid for consumers to translate complex data shown on nutrition label into a simplified, more understandable information.
<br>
<br>
The aims and objectives were met in the project. The mobile application was able to detect ingredients and match them to the database. A list of information regarding the uses of ingredients is then displayed. However, the feature of  highlighting nutrients that was beyond the healthy range was not completed due to an unresolvable bug.
